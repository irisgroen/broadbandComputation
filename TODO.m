% to do broadband computation

% Q1 try to understand interaction between noise and log power (issue with
% zero values?)

% Q2 'temporal precision': compute for each temporal frequency the broadband
% amplitude for different settings of bandwidth(?)
% -> estimated broadband given a fixed level (input amplitude)

% Q3 amplifier noise try different implementations / response profiles?


% think about where 3d plot may come in useful (e.g. when comparing two
% analysis parameters at the samen time, e.g. noise and bandwidth)

% think about how to write down whats happening in equations rather than
% by simulaiton - compare hermes 2017 paper
